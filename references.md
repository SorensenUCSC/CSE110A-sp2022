### Textbooks

I will not require you to purchase any textbook for this class. However, I will be drawing from several of them throughout the quarter.

Our main text book is [Engineering: A Compiler](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper/dp/012088478X) or EAC. The university library has online copies of EAC [available](https://ucsc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CDL_SCR_INST/1jiojor/alma9914646210706531).

I will also draw from the classic [Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811#ace-g6796040015). There is no library online source available, but there may be other ways to obtain electronic copies of this book.
