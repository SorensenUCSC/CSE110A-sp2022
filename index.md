### Welcome to **CSE110A:** _Fundamentals of Compiler Design_, Spring 2022 Quarter at UCSC!

- **Instructor:** [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/)
- **Time:** Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays: 4:00 - 5:05 pm
- **Location:** Soc Sci 2 - 71 (new classroom!)

Hello and welcome to the fundamentals of compiler design class! 

In this class you will learn about compiler design and implementation. In the abstract, compilers explore many of the [foundational problems in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). In practice, compilers are [massive pieces of well-oiled software](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTg3OTQ), and are some of the engineering marvels of the modern world. 

_COVID Note_ : The last few years have been difficult due to the COVID pandemic. Public health concerns and policies remain volatile. The first priority in this class in your health and well-being. We will approach any challenges that arise with compassion and understanding. I expect that you will do the same, both to the teaching staff and to your classmates. We will follow university guidelines and work together to have a productive and fun quarter.

That said, this class is scheduled to be _in person_. This is not an asynchronous class, and it is known that learning outcomes will suffer if you do not attend the synchronous lectures. I may post lectures online for extra study materials, but you should not expect them to be an equitable substitute for in-person attendence (e.g. they do not capture discussions well, and occasionaly the equiptment has errors). If your situation requires asynchronous courses, I suggest you contact an undergraduate adviser to discuss alternative options.
