### Welcome to **CSE110A:** _Fundamentals of Compiler Design_, Spring 2022 Quarter at UCSC!

- **Instructor:** [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/)
- **Time:** Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays: 4:00 - 5:05 pm
- **Location:** Porter 144

Hello and welcome to the fundamentals of compiler design class! In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of parallel programming concepts, including parallel programming models, reasoning about concurrency, and implementing synchronization idioms. Over the last decade, systems have become more and more parallel, from our phones to supercomputers. Now, nearly every modern device now contains many compute units (e.g., CPUs). These different compute units can work together to solve problems more efficiently than individual cores; however, they must be programmed carefully, both in terms of performance and safety. We will learn how to approach parallel programming, from high-level reasoning to concrete implementations.

_COVID Note_ : Due to the new COVID variant, the first two weeks of class have been moved online. As we have all experienced, this is a volatile time in terms of public health. I know it has been difficult for everyone, and to different degrees. We will work together, stay organized, and be understanding. We will adapt to whatever constraints we need to. We will prioritize safety and well-being. Please take care of yourself. Contact me if you don't feel like you are performing at the best of your ability, and we can discuss various accommodations. Despite these disruptions, I am confident that we can have a positive and productive quarter. 

That said, this class is scheduled to be _in person_. We will follow the University guidelines, and we will return to in-person lectures as soon as possible. This is not an asynchronous class, and synchronous attendance will be part of your grade. If your situation requires asynchronous courses, I suggest you contact an undergraduate adviser to discuss alternative options.
